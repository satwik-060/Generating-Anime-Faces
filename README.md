# Generating-Anime-Faces-Using-DCGAN
- I have used DCGAN model for generating Anime Faces
- It is trained for 30 epochs
- The notebook for its training is present in this repository somewhere, please search it yourselves, most probably it is named something like `generating-animme-faces-with-dcgan.ipynb` or something like that.
- The Dataset is obtained from kaggle. I am lazy to add the names, references and links now, so I will surely update it some other time.
